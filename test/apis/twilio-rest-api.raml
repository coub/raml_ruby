      Credentials
      -----------
      
      All requests to Twilio's REST API require you to authenticate using [HTTP basic auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) to convey your identity. The username is your AccountSid (a 34 character string, starting with the letters AC). The password is your AuthToken. Your AccountSid and AuthToken are on the [Account Dashboard](http://www.twilio.com/user/account/) page.
      
      Most HTTP clients (including web-browsers) present a dialog or prompt for you to provide a username and password for HTTP basic auth. Most clients will also allow you to provide credentials in the URL itself. For example:
      
      ```
      https://{AccountSid}:{AuthToken}@api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts
      ```
      
      Retrieving Resources with the HTTP GET Method
      ---------------------------------------------
      
      You can retrieve a representation of a resource by GETting its url. The easiest way to do this is to copy and paste a URL into your web browser's address bar.
      
      ### Possible GET Response Status Codes
      
      * 200 OK: The request was successful and the response body contains the representation requested.
      * 302 FOUND: A common redirect response; you can GET the representation at the URI in the Location response header.
      * 304 NOT MODIFIED: Your client's cached version of the representation is still up to date.
      * 401 UNAUTHORIZED: The supplied credentials, if any, are not sufficient to access the resource.
      * 404 NOT FOUND: You know this one.
      * 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS: Your application is sending too many simultaneous requests.
      * 500 SERVER ERROR: We couldn't return the representation due to an internal server error.
      * 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE: We are temporarily unable to return the representation. Please wait for a bit and try again.
      
      Creating or Updating Resources with the HTTP POST and PUT Methods
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      
      Creating or updating a resource involves performing an HTTP PUT or HTTP POST to a resource URI. In the PUT or POST, you represent the properties of the object you wish to update as form urlencoded key/value pairs. Don't worry, this is already the way browsers encode POSTs by default. But be sure to set the HTTP Content-Type header to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" for your requests if you are writing your own client.
      
      ### Possible POST or PUT Response Status Codes
      
      * 200 OK: The request was successful, we updated the resource and the response body contains the representation.
      * 201 CREATED: The request was successful, we created a new resource and the response body contains the representation.
      * 400 BAD REQUEST: The data given in the POST or PUT failed validation. Inspect the response body for details.
      * 401 UNAUTHORIZED: The supplied credentials, if any, are not sufficient to create or update the resource.
      * 404 NOT FOUND: You know this one.
      * 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED: You can't POST or PUT to the resource.
      * 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS: Your application is sending too many simultaneous requests.
      * 500 SERVER ERROR: We couldn't create or update the resource. Please try again.
      
      Deleting Resources with the HTTP DELETE Method
      ----------------------------------------------
      
      To delete a resource make an HTTP DELETE request to the resource's URL. Not all Twilio REST API resources support DELETE.
      
      ### Possible DELETE Response Status Codes
      
      * 204 OK: The request was successful; the resource was deleted.
      * 401 UNAUTHORIZED: The supplied credentials, if any, are not sufficient to delete the resource.
      * 404 NOT FOUND: You know this one.
      * 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED: You can't DELETE the resource.
      * 429 TOO MANY REQUESTS: Your application is sending too many simultaneous requests.
      * 500 SERVER ERROR: We couldn't delete the resource. Please try again.
      
      HTTP Method Overloading
      -----------------------
      
      Twilio's REST API uses HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods. Since some HTTP clients do not support methods PUT and DELETE, you can simulate them via POST by appending the query string parameter _method (yes, underscore method) to a resource URL. Valid values are PUT and DELETE.
      
      For example, if you want to perform a DELETE request on a particular phone number resource you could:
      
      ```
      DELETE /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC30947.../IncomingPhoneNumbers/PN12345567789AFE4433
      ```
      
      But if your client is only capable of GET and POST, then you could perform a POST with a _method query string variable to achieve the same result:
      
      ```
      POST /2010-04-01/Accounts/AC30947.../IncomingPhoneNumbers/PN12345567789AFE4433?_method=DELETE
      ```

            # Rate limiting
            You can queue as many messages as you like, however Twilio will only send
            out SMS messages at a rate of one message per phone number per second. It
            is not possible to adjust this rate, and it does not vary based on the
            country in which your number is located.
            If you anticipate the need to send out a large number of messages
            quickly (a time-limited promotion, for example) or at a rate greater than
            one message per second, you can purchase additional numbers, increasing
            your outbound capacity.
            Short codes are not subject to the same rate limits as long-code numbers
            and may be a better option for you. Check out our short code FAQ or talk
            to our sales team to determine what is best for you.

            # Handling SMS Replies
            By specifying an SMS URL for your SMS enabled Twilio phone number, Twilio
            will make a request to your application to notify you when someone replies
            to a message you send. Twilio's request and your corresponding response are
            covered in the SMS portion of the TwiML documentation.

                    codes purchased from Twilio work here; you cannot (for example) spoof
                    SMS messages from your own cell phone number.

                    will use the same country code as the 'From' number. Twilio will also
                    attempt to handle locally formatted numbers for that country code (e.g.
                    (415) 555-1212 for US, 07400123456 for GB). If you are sending to a
                    different country than the 'From' number, you must include a '+' and
                    the country code to ensure proper delivery.

          Purchases a new phone number for your account. If a phone number is found
          for your request, Twilio will add it to your account and bill you for the
          first month's cost of the phone number. If Twilio cannot find a phone number
          to match your request, you will receive an HTTP 400 with Twilio error code
          21452.
          To find an available phone number to POST, use the subresources of the
          AvailablePhoneNumbers list resource.

            Release this phone number from your account. Twilio will no longer answer
            calls to this number, and you will stop being billed the monthly phone
            number fee. The phone number will eventually be recycled and potentially
            given to another customer, so use with care. If you make a mistake, contact
            us. We may be able to give you the number back.

                Posting a URL and Method to a Queue instance will dequeue a member from a
                queue and have the member's call begin executing the TwiML document at
                that URL.
                You can address either an individual member by CallSid or the front of the
                queue by addressing Front.
                When redirecting a member of a queue addressed by CallSid, only the first
                request will succeed and return a 200 response code. A second request will
                fail and return an appropriate 400 response code. When dequeuing the Front
                of the queue, the next call in the queue will be redirected.
